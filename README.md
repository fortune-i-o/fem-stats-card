## My process

### Technology Used

This project was built using the following frontend technologies and methodologies:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** To provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **CSS custom properties:** To efficiently manage and reuse style values throughout the project.
- **Flexbox:** To create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **SASS:** To write CSS more efficiently with nested rules, variables, and mixins.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** To create modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code.
- **Mobile-first workflow:** To ensure a better user experience on smaller screens and devices.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained knowledge and experience in utilizing the `mix-blend-mode` property to create overlay effects on images. This property allowed me to blend and combine the colors of overlapping elements to achieve visually appealing effects.

### Useful resources

Here are some resources that proved valuable in understanding and implementing the `mix-blend-mode` property:

- [MDN web docs - mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode): The MDN web docs provided comprehensive information about the `mix-blend-mode` property, including its syntax, available values, and examples. This resource deepened my understanding of how to use this property effectively.

- [SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation): The official SASS documentation served as a valuable reference for understanding the syntax, features, and capabilities of SASS.

By leveraging these resources and continuing to explore new concepts and techniques, I aim to further enhance my skills and create visually captivating designs in future projects.
